# Edge Function Deployment - Final Version

## Status: READY TO DEPLOY ✅

File: `supabase/functions/aql-assistant/index.ts`
Size: 602 lines
Build: ✓ Successful

## Critical Changes Applied

### 1. **Permissive Validation Philosophy** (Lines 323-342)
```
⚠️ PRESERVE USER INTENT: Never block queries. Suggest improvements via warnings only.
```

**Key Rules:**
- ✓ Exempt fields (sourcetype, event_time, etc.) always valid
- ✓ Fields in "Available Fields" list are valid
- ✓ Unknown fields get **soft WARNING** (not error)
- ✓ **NEVER block queries** for field mismatches
- ✓ **NEVER set valid=false** for missing fields

### 2. **Preserve User Intent** (Lines 344-371)
```
🎯 GOLDEN RULE: Preserve what the user wrote. Minimal corrections only.
```

**What Gets Preserved:**
- ✓ User's sourcetype value (keep "ms_defender" exactly as written)
- ✓ User's selected fields (keep "fields timestamp, app_type")
- ✓ Absence of time filters (don't force them)
- ✓ User's filter conditions and values

**What Gets Fixed:**
- count(field) → count() (syntax fix)
- AND → and (lowercase)
- Quote issues

### 3. **Response Format** (Lines 373-397)
```json
{
  "valid": true,  // Only false for CRITICAL syntax errors
  "errors": [],   // Only critical syntax errors
  "warnings": [], // Field warnings, suggestions
  "correctedQuery": "minimal changes preserving user intent"
}
```

### 4. **Exempt Fields Integration** (Lines 491-498)
Merges exempt fields with uploaded fields so AI sees complete list:
```typescript
const exemptFields = ['sourcetype', 'event_time', '_time', 'index', 'host', 'source'];
const allFields = [...new Set([...fields, ...exemptFields])];
```

## What This Fixes

### Before (Blocking):
- ❌ "sourcetype is not available" → Query blocked
- ❌ Missing time filter → Error added
- ❌ User wrote "ms_defender" → AI changed to "windows_event"

### After (Permissive):
- ✅ sourcetype always valid → Query allowed
- ✅ No time filter → Warning only, query allowed
- ✅ User wrote "ms_defender" → Kept exactly as written
- ✅ app_type in available fields → Recognized and validated

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Copy contents of `supabase/functions/aql-assistant/index.ts`
2. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → aql-assistant
3. Paste and Save

### Option 2: Supabase CLI (if authenticated)
```bash
cd /tmp/cc-agent/58003488/project
supabase functions deploy aql-assistant
```

## Test Cases After Deployment

### Test 1: sourcetype validation
```
| where sourcetype = "ms_defender"
| fields event_time
```
Expected: ✅ Valid (no errors about sourcetype)

### Test 2: app_type field
```
| where sourcetype = "ms_defender"
| fields timestamp, app_type, event_time
```
Expected: ✅ Valid (all fields recognized)

### Test 3: No time filter
```
| where sourcetype = "ms_defender"
| fields timestamp
```
Expected: ✅ Valid with warning: "Consider adding time filter"

### Test 4: Preserve user choices
```
| where sourcetype = "custom_source"
| fields my_field, another_field
```
Expected: ✅ Valid, keeps "custom_source", soft warning on unknown fields
